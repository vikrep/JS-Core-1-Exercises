/* Challenge 8: Paying back a friend

Nadia, Suzie and Katrina live together. They agreed to buy a kettle and three
mugs, and split the cost.

Nadia went to the shop and bought everything. Write a function to help her
figure out how much Suzie and Katrina owe her.

The function should accept the price of a kettle and the price of one of the
mugs, then return the value Suzie owes.

Test your function with different prices to see if it works.
